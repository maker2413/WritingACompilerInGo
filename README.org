#+TITLE: Writing A Compiler In Go.git

This is my repo containing the code that follows along with the book:
[[https://compilerbook.com/][Writing a Compiler in Go]].

This repository and the book are a sequel to [[https://github.com/maker2413/WritingAnInterpreterInGo][Writing An Interpreter In Go]]. In
this repository we build a compiler for the much loved "Monkey" programming
language.
